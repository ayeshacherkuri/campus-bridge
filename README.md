## 📌 Abstract

This is an integrated web application intended to facilitate end-to-end development of university students in both academic and coding domains. The platform combines a Learning Management System (LMS), structured coding modules, and AI-powered digital assistance.Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Flask (Python), and MySQL, the system allows faculties to manage academic content and attendance, and coding can be taught to students via an in-built compiler. Additional AI features give real-time suggestions for code, job match recommendations, and intelligent code reviews. REST APIs support seamless interaction between frontend and backend, and the development is enabled in a local environment using XAMPP. The platform uses different interfaces for students, faculty, and admins.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Universities generally lack a cohesive solution that integrates academic content delivery, systematic coding practice, and AI-based career preparedness. It leads to fragmented learning experiences, poor placement preparedness, and minimal real-time tracking for students, teachers, and administrators.

## ✅ Use Cases

### Student Panel
- See academic content, assignments, and attendance online.
- Practice coding streams (e.g., DSA, Web Development, Python) using an online compiler.
- Receive live code suggestions and debugging support from AI helpers.
- Monitor progress via skill heatmaps, badges, and streak analytics.
- Match with job profiles aligned with the individual's skill set.

### Faculty Panel
- Uploading and handling academic material, e.g., PDFs, videos, quizzes
- Developing and assigning coding problems with test cases specified
- Tracking both academic and coding performance for individual students
- Tests and feedback online provision

### Admin/Placement Panel
- View skill measures and coding leaderboards across the university.
- Monitor scholarship eligibility and compute the placement readiness index.
- Schedule mock tests, coding contests, and create performance analytics.
- Shortlist high performers for recruitment and placement drives.
